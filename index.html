                    <p>Being vegan is great for your health! According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, vegans
                        are less likely to develop heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and high blood pressure than
                        meat-eaters are. Restaurants range from inexpensive and informal lunching or dining places
                        catering to people working nearby, with modest food served in simple settings at low prices.</p>
