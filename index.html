                    <p>Being vegan is great for your health! According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, vegans
                        are less likely to develop heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and high blood pressure than
                        meat-eaters are. Restaurants range from inexpensive and informal lunching or dining places
                        catering to people working nearby, with modest food served in simple settings at low prices.</p>

                <p> Restaurants around the country are focusing on summer staples for promotions in July. You're looking at grill classics like hot dogs and cold treats to cool you down. It's no surprise that both National Ice Cream Day and National Hot Dog Day arrive this month. They're joined by National Fried Chicken Day, National Ice Cream Month, National French Fries Day, and, of course, the 4th of July, which isn't a food holiday but also kind of is. </p>
